## _Let's delve deeper into 'git' - a powerful version control system!_

**And what better ways there are compared to learning from a few examples!**


### _Examples_

> **_01_**

```bash
git branch
# *master

# displays which local branch you're currently working on
```

---

```bash
git branch -m main

# changes the name of your current branch to main
```

---

```bash
git branch -r

# origin/HEAD -> origin/master
# origin/develop
# origin/master

# displays the existing branches in the remote repository
```

> **_02_**

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

# create a new branch and simultaneously switch to that branch
```

**To be honest, I don't think a few showcases of me using the git command would make a difference to anybody who's new to the whole vcs business, but that doesn't stop us from trying now, does it? :)**
